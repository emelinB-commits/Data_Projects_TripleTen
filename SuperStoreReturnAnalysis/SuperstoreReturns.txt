## Project Overview

I have created a worksheet for each, TOTAL SALES, TOTAL PROFTI, and RETURN RATE.
On the dashboard I have created a table to breakdown the returns by subcategory, named "SubCategory Returns". I have also broke down the returns by state using a map and show a breakdown of each states returns by category. I have also created a table that breakdown returns by day of the week. You can also find a bar chart with returns by customers. I broke down the returns by month as well and used a scatter plot for sales and returns


## Tools Used

- Tableau Public

## Findings and Conclusion

I have found that Office Supplies has the biggest return rate in the store. I would recommend cutting back on this category. I have also found that California has the biggest rate of returns.
